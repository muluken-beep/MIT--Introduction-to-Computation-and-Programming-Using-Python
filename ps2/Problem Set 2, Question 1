"""
First, implement the function is_word_guessed that takes in two parameters a
string, secret_word , and a list of letters (strings), letters_guessed. This function
returns a boolean True
if secret_word has been guessed (i.e., all the letters of
secret_word are in letters_guessed ), and False otherwise. This function will be
useful in helping you decide when the hangman game has been successfully
completed, and becomes an endtest
for any iterative loop that checks letters against
the secret word.

For this function, you may assume that all the letters in secret_word and
letters_guessed are lowercase.

# Example Usage:
>>> secret_word = 'apple'
>>> letters_guessed = ['e', 'i', 'k', 'p', 'r', 's']
>>> print(is_word_guessed(secret_word, letters_guessed) )
False
